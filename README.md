# Connect4-Game

## Introduction

Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

This Python implementation uses the Pygame library to provide a simple graphical interface for playing the game.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend locally.
- Player vs AI: Play against an AI opponent.
- Simple AI strategy: The AI uses a random move strategy to make its moves.

## Game Instructions

Player 1 (Red) and Player 2 (Yellow) take turns dropping their colored discs into the grid.
Click on a column to drop a disc into the lowest available slot in that column.
The first player to connect four discs of their color in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## AI Player

The AI player (Player 2) uses a simple random move strategy to determine its moves.
It randomly selects a column and places its yellow disc in the lowest available slot in that column.
